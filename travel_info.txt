Daniel Szyld: I would like to give my talk just before lunch
any day.

Oliver Salazar Celis: For sure, 17 August (the last day) will be impossible to speak for me given return travels; If possible 14 or 15 August would be preferred. 

Eleuterio Toro: Since it is likely I will depart before the end of the conference (unfortunately)

Daan Huybrechs: Iâ€™d rather not speak on the first day 




Annan's progress in his graduate studies is remarkable, and he has demonstrated a range of strengths that bode well for his future success. His exceptional mathematical abilities, coupled with his creativity and attention to detail, make him a highly productive and innovative individual with the potential to excel in a postdoc and tenure-track position in the future. He is an exceptional person. So exceptional, in fact, that I give him my hardest, most impactful problems. He struggles, of course, but we learn a lot. He makes more progress on them than anyone else in the world, and one day he will have a big result if he keeps doing this.  Generally, I want him to improve the quality of his papers a little so we can aim for the absolute top journals. With his talent, he should be aiming at attention-grabbing results. His verbal communication skills have improved significantly over the last year. I find that he is excellent at explaining things now. 

One area for development is his writing skills. While his memos are well-written and coherent, his longer documents lack a global cohesive structure. It might be as simple as sitting down for a whole day (before starting to write the paper), writing a plan, and understanding the main messages of the research. My guess is he rushes this step. 

Annan has the potential to become a highly accomplished researcher. He is a world-class applied math graduate student in my opinion.
