## Travel support

The deadline for travel support was 28 February 2023.

We have bursaries available to support the registration, accommodation, and travel costs for attendees who would otherwise struggle to come for financial reasons,
such as early-career researchers (MSc students, PhD students,
and postdocs) or those working in countries with a less developed research infrastructure. To apply for this,
please email the three organisers with
 - a budget,
 - a brief research statement,
 - your talk abstract (if you would like to give a talk),
 - a letter of support from your supervisor (for early-career researchers),
ideally as one PDF.

## Conference banquet

The conference banquet will take place on Tuesday Aug 15 in Balliol College, Oxford. Balliol was founded in 1263 and counts Adam Smith, Aldous Huxley, four prime ministers, and five Nobel laureates as alumni.
The dress code for the banquet will be business formal (jacket or suit and tie for men).
